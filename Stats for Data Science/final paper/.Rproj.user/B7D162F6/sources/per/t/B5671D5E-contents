# Research Question

* What are the types, sizes, prices, genres, and categories of the top-rated apps? 
* Is it possible to predict an appâ€™s rating given its other attributes? 

# Data
## Google Play Store Apps from Kaggle
* 10,841 records
* 13 columns

The fields after data cleaning and processing:

Fields' Name | Fields' Description | Data Type
------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------
App          | The name of the app | Categoric
Category     | The category which the app belongs to | Categoric
Rating       | Overall user rating of the app | Numeric
Reviews      | The number of user reviews for the app | Numeric
Size         | The size of the app | Numeric
Installs     | Number of user downloads/installs for the app | Numeric
Price        | Price of the app | Numeric
Content Rating | Age group which the app is targeted at | Categoric
Genres       | An app can belong to multiple genres | Categoric
DaysFromLastUpdate | Numbers of days from the date of last update | Numeric

# Analysis

## Graphs

## Multiple Regression

### Variable Selection Techiques

For this dataset, the result formulas generated by _Forward Selection_, _Backward Elimination_, and _Stepwise Selection_ are the same.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
formula = Rating ~ log(Reviews) + log(Installs) + Category + DaysFromLastUpdate + Size + Price
```

Variable     | Estimate Coefficient 
------------ | -------------------
log(Review) | 0.157
log(Installs)  | -0.1379
DaysFromLastUpdate | -0.0001583

# Conclusion

* In general, it is hard to predict whether an app has a good rating based on attributes such as types, sizes, prices, genres, and categories. But an app has more reviews is likely to have a higher rating.

* The model's R-Square and Adjusted R-Square are both very low; it may imply that there are still many factors influencing an app's user rating but not included in the dataset. Some of the factors may even be difficult to be quantified or categorized. 

* Variable selection techniques are more sophisticated than manually selecting variables.
